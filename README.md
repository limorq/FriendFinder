# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is an application designed to simulate a dating app. It allows the user to input their name and a link to their photo. Then asks the user to answer 10 questions which will be comapred to other user's answers. A calculation algorythm was created to compare each answer to other users and create a score that will ultimately equal or come close to someone else's score for a 'match'. A box will then pop-up displaying your match and their photo.

This application does not use a database to store user info and scores. Instead we were asked to store this information in an array of objects contained in a separate file. This program can be easily converted to use a DB to store, update, or delete user information.

The purpose of this assigment was to demonstrate our knowledge of Node and working with npm packages and routing api calls to extract the necessay information when needed to perform calculations and return information back to the user.
